## Welcome Back

### Exploring Github to document and share some of the projects that I have try out while self-learning coding. 

It's has been awhile since I have start picking up coding. Wish to do some simple but yet interesting and useful project. Most of the learning were done through Udemy and the primary coding language is Python. 

Currently am attending a 6-month Data Analaytic course, will try to upload some notebooks to document the learning process.
